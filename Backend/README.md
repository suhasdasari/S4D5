# Backend Workspace (Rebooted)

This folder now tracks the three-agent council for the ETHDenver hedge fund build. Each subdirectory is owned by a specific operator + clawbot:

| Directory        | Human + Bot            | Focus                                                         |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `helix/`         | Suhas + Alpha Strategist| Frontend migration to Scaffold-ETH 2, strategist brain, orchestration|
| `auditoracle/`   | Susmitha + AuditOracle | Risk engine, compliance scribe, 0g + Hedera attestation flows |
| `executionhand/` | Karthik + ExecutionHand| Hedera/ADI execution stack, wallets, infra, Vercel deployment |

Each folder contains a living `ROADMAP.md` to capture tasks until the Nerve Cord bridge is online. Update them as you ship.
